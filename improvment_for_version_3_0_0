1. Simplify & Harden the API✅
Make totalSubSteps Derivable
Instead of requiring both totalSteps/totalSubSteps and subStepsPerStep, infer totalSteps = subStepsPerStep.length and totalSubSteps = subStepsPerStep.sum(). This removes redundancy and assertion failures.

Unified Constructor Validation
Wrap your asserts into a static helper that gives clearer error messages (e.g. “Expected screens length (5) to equal totalSubSteps (4)”).

Flatten Callback Signatures
Rather than separate onNextValidation and onBackValidation, consider a single Future<bool> Function(NavigationDirection direction, int step, int subStep)? onValidate; with an enum of forward/backward.

Button Loading States
If onValidation is asynchronous, disable the Next button and show a spinner until it completes.✅

2. Extensibility & Plug-Ins✅
Plugin Hooks
Expose lifecycle callbacks such as onStepEnter(int stepIndex) so consumers can trigger data fetches.
also onStepComplete, onExit, onFlowComplete

Step-Level Configuration
Allow passing per-step settings (e.g. some steps or sub-step skip validation, others have custom buttons).



3. Testing & Documentation
Unit & Widget Tests
Cover boundary conditions: first/last step, validation failures, rapid back-and-forth taps.

Comprehensive Example App
Ship an example that shows:

Linear flow

Branching (conditional next)

Custom step indicators

API Docs & Changelog
Document each prop in dartdoc, track breaking changes in CHANGELOG.md.

4. Performance & Size ✅

Debounce Rapid Presses
Prevent UI thrashing if Next/Back are tapped repeatedly.

Tree Shaking
Review imports—e.g. drop freezed if you don’t need union types beyond a single state class.



Adopting these enhancements will make StepsNavigator more robust, flexible, and delightful to use.
